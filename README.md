TensorFlow for MachineLearning

Tensorflow is a frame work and it is widely used for machine learning
I Have just started to learn it

It is quiet difficult initially as we have to understand its IDE , there are different IDEs for python but for particular datascience and machinelearning
it is prefered to use ANACONDA, it is a distribution of python and it is like you can find all in one for datadscience and machinelerning
